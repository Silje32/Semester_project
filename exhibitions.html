                      class="celso"/>
                 <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
                   ´The Sky Above Us´, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
                    about the universe around us. We´ll locate the various constellations
                    and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators
                    who used the stars to travel by.</p>
                 <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders,
                    to Galileo´s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in
                    our solar system</p>

                <img src="images/photos/mammoth.jpg" alt="a mammoth"
                     class="mammoth"/>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
                   question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?
                   Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
                   framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
                   know today have evolved our time.</p>
                <p>You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn´t
                   survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of
                   dinosaurs too.</p>

              <h2 class="heading3_exhibitions">Biology and Medicine</h2>
                <img src="images/photos/body.jpg" alt="a plastic human on the inside"
                     class="human"/>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology
                   are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p>
                <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality
                   of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
                   medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and
                   take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
                   penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
                <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab,
                   but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures
                   have beat us to it.</p>

                <img src="images/photos/robotics.jpeg" alt="a boy playing with a robot"
                     class="robot"/>
                <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence
                   are the science of the future. From useful home applications of AI to
                   industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say
                   hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

                <img src="images/photos/global.jpeg" alt="the world in different environments"
                     class="world"/>
                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet,
                   the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create
                   a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>
                <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently
                   face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution.
                   But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter
                   future.</p>

              <p>It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the
                 Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures
                 on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this
                 exciting ´space´.</p>

              <p>Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you
                 sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own
                 sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the wonders
                 of science.</p>
              <h3 class="heading4_exhibitions">Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h3>
              <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
                 exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It´s a series of
                 installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
                 elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting,
                 to ´Wind Island´that shows how turbines are able to use and control
                 wind to create power.</p>
