                   <p>There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very
                      welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and accessible
                      to the whole community.</p>
                   <p>You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum´s
                      collections. If you have some item or collection that you think others
                      would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department
                      and they will be able to assist you.</p>

                 <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays
                    in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.</p>
                 <p>Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of
                    a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where
                    all staff volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits
                    and strategies for the museum.</p>
                 <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact
                    us if you´d like to find out more about how you can get involved.</p>
