        <p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
           to making science accessible to all.<p>
        <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
           early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
           everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
           life itself.<p>
        <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
           experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
           lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">OUR VISION</h2>
        <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
           brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
           different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore.
           Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play
           around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur
           exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>
